                    From the nineteen-fifties until a few years before she died, in 2009, destitute at the age of
                    eighty-three, <stong> Maier took at least a hundred and fifty thousand pictures, mostly in Chicago,
                        and showed them to
                        nobody.</stong>

                    It’s telling, perhaps, that one of her favorite motifs was to shoot her own shadow. For decades, she
                    supported herself as a nanny in the wealthy enclaves of the city. But her real work was roaming the
                    streets with her camera (often with her young charges in tow), capturing images of sublime
                    spontaneity, wit, and compositional savvy.

                    Maier’s covert work might have languished in obscurity if not for the chance acquisition, in 2007,
                    of a cache of negatives, prints, contact sheets, and unprocessed rolls of film, all seized from a
                    storage locker because she fell behind on the rent. When John Maloof, a Chicago real-estate agent,
                    bought the material, everything about Maier’s identity was a mystery except for her name. It was
                    only when he ran across her death notice, two years later, that her story began to unfold. (His
                    wonderful documentary on the subject, “Finding Vivian Maier,” was nominated for an Academy Award in
                    2015. )

                    Maier shot in both color and black-and-white; perhaps to establish her credibility as a “serious”
                    artist, the first of her pictures to be widely disseminated were the latter. Now that Maier has
                    earned her place alongside Arbus, Robert Frank, Lee Friedlander, Lisette Model, Garry Winogrand, and
                    other giants of the American street, a new book, “Vivian Maier: The Color Work,” and a related
                    exhibition at Howard Greenberg Gallery (opening on November 14th) consider her eye for the vivid.

                    Maier is such an original artist that it feels a like a cheat to play games of compare and contrast.

                    forensic photos of automobile accidents deserve to be more widely known.
                    The Beetle was yellow, a color that brings out Maier’s best.

                    Warhol silkscreen of flowers and the allover compositions of AbEx. (Note that Maier was shooting her
                    shadow in the nineteen-fifties, roughly a decade before Friedlander, who is renowned for the
                    gesture, did the same. ) The same year, she came across two men on a sidewalk—one standing, one
                    striding—both wearing canary shorts and lemon-fizz socks. To their right is a woman in a sensibly
                    dark woolly cardigan and a daffodil-colored skirt.
